# DiffXenoScope
> Y. Biondi, R. Peres

Code for diffusion studies with Xenoscope, a 2.6m LXe TPC for DARWIN R&D. 
Initial drift and diffusion code from Y. Biondi. 

### TO DO

Expected improvements to come:
  [] - Adding light response (SiPM array)
      [] - Grids and extraction
      [] - Photon production
      [] - Photon detection
  [] - Electron transverse and longitudinal diffusion in LXe parameter limits
  [] - Proper LCE? (G4)
  [] - Proper focusing? (GARFIELD, Kassiopeia)
